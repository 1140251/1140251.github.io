In development!

<!--
I know, I know. If you are a developer, you probably have seen this kind of post multiple times. I also have seen them, but most of them are focused on free and specific development resources.

I’m a firm believer that as a software developer, that wants to be more than a simple programmer, should be aware of how things work in all the development phases.
This process is known as the software development life cycle (SDLC). But if you want to know the SDLC, consider reading this article :point_right: [SDLC](https://www.ntaskmanager.com/blog/software-development-life-cycle-sdlc/) and check the :point_right: [Netflix Development Cycle](https://netflixtechblog.com/full-cycle-developers-at-netflix-a08c31f83249). With the fact that you know SDLC, you might begin to explore different ways of doing something and by that opening up your horizon to new methodologies and technologies.

Getting straight to the point, there are some tools to learn and explore new methodologies and technologies. Some more abroad and others with very specific topics. Let’s get to it!

### Books :books:

Reading a book is on of the best way to progress as a software developer. There is a ton of books in software development, books that deal with specific languages, design patterns, or even general development. Finding a great books is not easy, but there some books that never get old and that are often recommended by many developers.
